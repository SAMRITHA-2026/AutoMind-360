AutoMind 360™ is an advanced Agentic AI–driven Autonomous Predictive Maintenance and Proactive Service Scheduling platform designed for large automotive OEMs and service networks operating across India. The solution aims to shift the business from a reactive aftersales model to a predictive, customer-centric, and quality-driven ecosystem, improving vehicle uptime, customer satisfaction, and manufacturing excellence.

At the heart of AutoMind 360™ lies a Master Agent that orchestrates multiple intelligent Worker AI Agents to manage the complete maintenance lifecycle. The system continuously ingests real-time vehicle telematics, sensor data, diagnostic trouble codes, and historical maintenance records. Using advanced machine learning models, the Diagnosis and Data Analysis Agents predict potential mechanical failures well before breakdowns occur, prioritize risks, and estimate remaining useful life of critical components.

A standout feature of the solution is its voice-based Customer Engagement Agent, which proactively contacts vehicle owners, explains vehicle health conditions in a simple and persuasive manner, and recommends timely service actions. This human-like interaction builds trust and significantly increases service acceptance rates. In parallel, the Scheduling Agent forecasts overall service demand, optimizes service center capacity, and autonomously books appointments based on customer preferences and availability.

AutoMind 360™ also establishes a closed manufacturing feedback loop. Predicted failures are correlated with historical RCA/CAPA and defect data to identify recurring issues and automatically generate actionable insights for manufacturing teams, enabling continuous product and process improvement. To ensure safe and compliant autonomy, an integrated UEBA security layer monitors agent behavior, detects anomalies, and prevents unauthorized access or actions. Overall, AutoMind 360™ delivers measurable improvements in operational efficiency, customer retention, and product quality through secure and intelligent Agentic AI orchestration.
