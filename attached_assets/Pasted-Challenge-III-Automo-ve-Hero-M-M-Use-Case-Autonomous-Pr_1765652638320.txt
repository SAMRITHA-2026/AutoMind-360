Challenge III: Automo ve [Hero + M&M] 
Use Case: Autonomous Predictive Maintenance and Proactive Service Scheduling with 
Manufacturing Feedback loop 
About the Business: 
A leading automotive OEM and service network in India provides aftersales maintenance services 
to a large customer base across metros and tier-2 cities. The business aims to increase customer 
retention, reduce vehicle breakdowns, optimize service center utilization, and improve 
manufacturing quality by proactively predicting maintenance needs, autonomously scheduling 
service appointments, and feeding insights back to the manufacturing team. 
To achieve this, the company plans to deploy a web-based Agentic AI system acting as a Master 
Agent orchestrating multiple Worker AI agents to handle end-to-end predictive maintenance, 
customer engagement, service scheduling, and manufacturing quality improvement—using real
time vehicle data, historical maintenance logs, and CAPA/RCA records. 
The Problem Statement 
Business Problem: 
The company wants to improve vehicle uptime, enhance customer experience, and drive 
product quality improvements by: 
1. Proactively predicting mechanical failures before they occur. 
2. Autonomously scheduling service appointments to minimize unplanned downtime. 
3. Leveraging RCA/CAPA insights from maintenance and manufacturing logs to improve 
design and reduce recurring defects. 
Goal: 
Design an Agentic AI solution where a Master Agent orchestrates multiple Worker AI agents to 
autonomously: 
1. Continuously analyze real-time vehicle sensor data and historical maintenance logs 
using vehicle telematics 
2. Predict upcoming mechanical issues using advanced diagnostics and failure prediction 
models. 
3. Proactively contact vehicle owners with personalized maintenance recommendations 
primarily via voice-based agents, with mobile app notifications as a secondary channel. . 
4. Forecast general service demand from maintenance history and vehicle usage patterns 
to optimize service center workloads and appointment planning. 
5. Manage appointment scheduling by coordinating service center availability and 
customer preferences. 
6. Track service progress until completion and follow-up for customer feedback. 
7. Perform RCA/CAPA-driven analysis by cross-referencing predicted failures with historical 
maintenance and manufacturing defect records to suggest preventive actions, best
practice solutions, and feed insights back to manufacturing teams for quality 
improvement. 
8. Ensure security and compliance by implementing UEBA (User and Entity Behaviour 
Analytics) for Agentic AI to monitor autonomous agent interactions, detect anomalies, 
and prevent unauthorized actions during orchestration. (Refer TIPS at the bottom for 
UEBA Understanding ) 
Key Deliverable: 
A 5 slides PPT showcasing: 
• Continuous vehicle monitoring and predictive failure detection. 
• Forecasting general service demand and autonomous scheduling based on vehicle usage 
and maintenance patterns. 
• Persuasive customer engagement via voice agent. 
• RCA/CAPA-based insights generation and feedback to manufacturing for quality 
improvement. 
• UEBA in action – detecting abnormal agent behavior or preventing unauthorized access. 
Agentic AI Roles 
1. Master Agent (Main Orchestrator): 
• Monitors vehicle health data streams and overall conversational flow. 
• Coordinates Worker Agents in diagnosis, customer outreach, scheduling, and 
feedback collection and insight feeding to manufacturing team 
• Ensures all agent interactions comply with security policies through UEBA-based 
anomaly detection 
• Initiates and ends customer interactions. 
2. Worker Agents: 
• Data Analysis Agent: Continuously analyzes streaming vehicle telematics and 
sensor data plus maintenance history to detect early warning signs and forecast 
likely maintenance needs or service demand 
• Diagnosis Agent: Runs predictive models to assess probable component failures 
and assigns priority levels. 
• Customer Engagement Agent: Initiates personalized conversations with vehicle 
owners via chatbot to explain predicted issues and recommend service. 
• Scheduling Agent: Checks service center capacity, proposes appointment slots, 
and confirms bookings with customers. 
• Feedback Agent: Follows up post-service to capture customer satisfaction and 
update vehicle maintenance records. 
• Manufacturing Quality Insights Module : Automatically generates actionable 
insights for the manufacturing team by analyzing predicted failures and historical 
CAPA/RCA data to improve product design and reduce recurring defects. 
Data & System Assumptions 
• Synthetic Vehicle Data: Data for 10 example vehicles including sensor readings, usage 
patterns, maintenance history, and diagnostic trouble codes. 
• Telematics API: Mock real-time sensor data feed. 
• Maintenance Records Server: Dummy database of historical repairs and service visits 
(can leverage open-source automotive datasets from Kaggle, UCI Repository, 
HuggingFace, etc.). 
• Service Center Scheduler: Mock API to retrieve available appointment slots and confirm 
bookings. 
• Customer Interaction Layer: Simulated voice-based virtual agent as the primary interface 
for owner communication, supplemented by app notifications for reminders and 
confirmations 
• Security Layer: UEBA integrated to monitor Master and Worker Agents for anomalous or 
malicious behaviours (e.g., unauthorized API calls or unexpected workflow changes). 
• Forecasting & RCA Data: Historical maintenance, manufacturing CAPA, and RCA records. 
Submission Format: A 5 slider PPT 
Tips for Participants 
• Emphasize persuasive and human-like chatbot/Voice agent conversations explaining the 
vehicle's condition and convincing owners to book services. 
• Showcase how the Master Agent coordinates real-time data analysis, predictive 
modeling, service demand forecasting, customer engagement, and appointment 
scheduling seamlessly, while integrating manufacturing feedback loops. 
• Demonstrate edge cases like declined appointments, urgent failure alerts, or multi
vehicle fleet scheduling, and recurring defects. Show how RCA/CAPA analysis informs 
better decision-making in these cases. 
• What is UEBA - UEBA uses advanced analytics and machine learning to establish 
behavioural baselines for users and entities (including AI agents) and detect anomalies 
that indicate potential threats or unauthorized activities. 
Example of UEBA: “In the predictive maintenance system, UEBA can monitor the 
Master Agent and Worker Agents for unusual activities—for instance, if the 
Scheduling Agent suddenly tries to access vehicle telematics data (which it 
normally doesn’t need), UEBA will flag this as anomalous behaviour and trigger an 
alert.” 
• Show how predicted failures and RCA/CAPA patterns are fed back to manufacturing 
teams to improve product design, reduce recurring defects, and close the loop between 
aftersales and production.
