# **AutoMind 360™**

## ***Agentic AI–Driven Autonomous Predictive Maintenance & Proactive Service Scheduling***

---

## **Project Overview**

**AutoMind 360™** is an **Agentic AI–powered Autonomous Predictive Maintenance platform** built for large automotive OEMs and aftersales service networks operating across India. The objective of this project is to transform the traditional **reactive aftersales model** into a **predictive, proactive, customer-centric, and quality-driven ecosystem**.

This project was developed as part of **EY Techathon 6.0**.

## **Problem Statement**

Current automotive aftersales ecosystems face the following challenges:

* ❌ Reactive breakdown-based maintenance
* ❌ Low preventive service adoption by customers
* ❌ Inefficient service center scheduling
* ❌ Lack of feedback loop between service data and manufacturing
* ❌ Poor visibility into early failure patterns

## ***Core Challenge***

To design an **intelligent, autonomous, and secure system** that can:

* Predict failures before breakdowns
* Engage customers proactively
* Optimize service operations
* Feed actionable insights back to manufacturing

---

##  **Proposed Solution – AutoMind 360™**

AutoMind 360™ introduces an **Agentic AI architecture** where a **Master Agent** orchestrates multiple **Worker AI Agents** to manage the complete vehicle maintenance lifecycle autonomously.

 ***Key Capabilities***

* Predictive failure detection
* Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation
* Voice-based customer engagement
* Autonomous service scheduling
* Closed-loop manufacturing feedback
* Secure agent orchestration using UEBA

## **Agentic AI Architecture**

###  **Master Agent**

* Central orchestration layer
* Controls decision flow across agents
* Applies risk prioritization and autonomy rules

###  **Worker AI Agents**

### ***1. Data Ingestion & Analysis Agent***

* Ingests real-time telematics & sensor data
* Processes historical service and DTC records
* Detects anomalies and abnormal usage patterns

### ***2. Diagnosis & Prediction Agent***

* Applies ML models (LSTM, XGBoost, Time-Series)
* Predicts potential component failures
* Estimates Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
* Assigns risk and severity levels

### ***3. Voice-Based Customer Engagement Agent*** ⭐

* Proactively contacts vehicle owners
* Explains vehicle health in simple language
* Builds trust through human-like interaction
* Increases preventive service acceptance

### ***4. Autonomous Scheduling Agent***

* Forecasts service demand
* Optimizes service center capacity
* Considers technician availability & customer preferences
* Auto-books service appointments

### ***5. Manufacturing Feedback Agent***

* Correlates predicted failures with RCA/CAPA data
* Identifies recurring manufacturing defects
* Generates actionable insights for quality teams

### ***6. UEBA Security Agent***

* Monitors agent behavior continuously
* Detects anomalies or unauthorized actions
* Ensures safe and compliant autonomy

---

## **End-to-End Workflow**

1. Vehicle telematics & diagnostics data collected
2. Data Analysis Agent detects anomalies
3. Diagnosis Agent predicts failure & RUL
4. Master Agent evaluates priority & risk
5. Customer Engagement Agent contacts owner
6. Scheduling Agent books service autonomously
7. Service data is updated post-completion
8. Manufacturing insights generated via RCA/CAPA
9. UEBA monitors all agent actions

***➡️ Result: A closed-loop intelligent maintenance ecosystem***
